               <p> Hey guys, heeey! My name's <strong> Ma. Carmela F. Aquillo </strong>. But hey, who calls a person by their whole freaking name?! So, for the convenience of everybody (myself included), just call me <q>Car</q>! I was born on the 14th of January, 1995, somewhere in Quezon City (sorry I forgot the name of the hospital already, haha). A few things about myself: 1) I actually like being alone, like I don't find it odd at all or unsettling when I am but put me in a room full of strangers (that look decent enough and acceptable to society), chances are I'd leave that room with new-found friends; 2) I <strong> secretly </strong> like signing, dancing, and photography; and 3) I'm a very easy person to be around with; that <em> is </em> according to my friends okay, not my words. Oh! Wanna hear something funny? My previous swimming teacher during gradeschool actually <em> tossed me to the deep part of the swimming pool </em> ...which thankfully didn't kill me. </p>

               <p> Speaking of gradeschool, my previous alma mater before <abbr title ="University of the Philippines Los Banos">UPLB</abbr> was Assumption Antipolo - a school also situated on a mountain, mind you, thus the clean environment here in the university isn't that new to me. There, I developed a love for reading. A few of my favorites are by Haruki Murakami and J.K. Rowling. I remember reading this particular book (which, alas, I can't seem to remember the title right now) that made me so happy because it was a mixture of two things I liked - books and photography. It's not a photography book, okay; it was a fiction book :) Anyways, hmm...the instructions for this exercise said to input memorable quotations learned from school. I uhh, can't really remember anything right now but I think I can say that <em >school, in itself, is a memorable quote </em>... You might think it's strange and kind of absurd but I feel like there were a lot of memorable quotes from before that it all becomes muddled and mixed up into one giant quote. Hey, to each their own, right? :) </p>
