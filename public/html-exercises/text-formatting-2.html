               <h2> ALL ABOUT ME </h2>
               <p> Hey guys, heeey! My name's <strong> Ma. Carmela F. Aquillo </strong>. But hey, who calls a person by their whole freaking name?! So, for the convenience of everybody (myself included), just call me <q>Car</q>! I was born on the 14th of January, 1995, somewhere in Quezon City (sorry I forgot the name of the hospital already haha). A few things about myself: 1) I actually like being alone, like I don't find it odd at all or unsettling when I am; 2) I <strong> (secretly) </strong> like signing, dancing, and photography; and 3) my previous swimming teacher during gradeschool actually <em> tossed me to the deep part of the swimming pool </em> ...which thankfully didn't kill me. </p>

               <p> Speaking of gradeschool, my previous alma mater before <abbr title ="University of the Philippines Los Banos">UPLB</abbr> was Assumption Antipolo - a school also situated on a mountain, thus the environment here in the university isn't that alien to me. There, I developed a love for reading. A few of my favorites are by Haruki Murakami and J.K. Rowling. I remember reading this particular book (which, alas, I can't seem to remember the title right now) that made me so happy because it was a mixture of two things I like - books and photography. Oh! It's not a photography book okay? It was a fiction book :) Anyways, hmm...the instructions said to input memorable quotations learned from school. I uhh, can't really remember anyting right now but I think I can say that school, in itself, is a memorable quote... You might think it strange and kind of absurd but CONTINUE THIS RIGHT HERE </p>
