               <em>My Top 3 Movie Picks</em>
               <p>Let's work our way backwards, shall we? Earning the bronze medal for being my third favorite movie - Flipped. At first I thought this movie would just be <q><em>meh</em></q>. But after giving in to the constant pleads of my <em>main nigga</em> to watch it, I realized that <q>it was actually a <strong>good</strong> movie</q>. The movie had an almost-childlike innocence to it, downplaying the cheesiness of the story itself. Aside from that, the cinematography and the original soundtrack of the movie was very <strong>spot on</strong>. An added bonus: a good-looking lead actor and the wardrobe of the lead actress that is to die for.</p>
               <p>Winning the silver medal, the tag-team of The Little Mermaid and The Lion King. I am so sorry but these two have really got to go with each other. Aside from these two being a list of the Disney classics, they've actually played a very large part in my childhood.
