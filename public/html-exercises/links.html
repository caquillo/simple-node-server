               <em>Watch these with me or no popcorn for you; 3 FILMS AT THE TOP OF MY LIST</em>
               <p> Let's work our way backwards, shall we? Earning the bronze medal for being my third favorite movie - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0817177/?ref_=ttqt_qt_tt">Flipped</a>, a movie wherein two eighth-graders proved that indeed, opposites really do attract. At first I thought this movie would just be <q><em>okay</em></q> since I've read the book; we all know what happens to books-gone-movies. But after giving into the constant pleads of my <em>main nigga</em> to watch it, I realized that <q>it was actually a <strong> good </strong> one</q>. The movie had an almost-childlike innocence to it, downplaying the cheesiness of the story itself. Aside from that, the cinematography and the original soundtrack of the movie was very <strong> spot on </strong>. A little spoiler: a good-looking lead actor and the wardrobe of the lead actress that is to die for. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92SgWpDYjlo">Here's</a> the trailer if you guys want to see a sneak peak :) </p>
               <p> And in second place, winning the silver medal, the tag-team of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097757/">The Little Mermaid</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110357/">The Lion King</a>. I am so sorry but these two have really got to go with each other. Aside from these two being a part of the list of the Disney classics, they actually played a huge role in my childhood. Aside from boosting my liking for singing, I learned valuable lessons from these movies. The Little Mermaid helped me realize that you should never be sorry for who you are, that you should accept the reality that <em>this</em> is who you really are, even if it doesn't really coincide with society. The Lion King, with its <strong> awesome </strong> original soundtrack, showed me that despite the wrongs of people, you should still be compassionate about them. Also, I think <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/ff/69/59/ff695905e7ce9ac5247d06768b8893bf.jpg">this</a> <!--That is actually the Sahilli(?) symbol for Hakuna Matata! Amazing! New learning for the day--> comes in handy every once in a while... See the trailers of the two movies by clicking <a href="">this</a> or <a href="">this</a> and enjoy childhood once again :) </p>
               <p> Drum roll pleaaase! And the gold medal goes tooo, oh, ladies and gentlemen, <em>another</em> tag team! <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1454029/">The Help</a> and <a href="">The Kings of Summer</a>! Now I know these two movies are total opposites (or are they...), but I just can't really choose between substance and cinematography; I am only but human. <a href="">The Help</a>, where the awesome Viola Davis raised to fame, is <strong> legit </strong> a tear-jerker. I loved the fact that even though the character she was playing was the center of the story, the story didn't really revolve just around her. Her character always seemed to be in the background but you could still establish that she's the main character. It just blows me away how everything came together. Definitely a must-watch! I loved the movie <a href="">The Kings of Summer</a> because of its cinematography and original soundtrack. Yes, I know it seems to be such a lame reason but <em>seriously</em>, I LOVED IT. The plot of the movie was a little bit weird, however, I think it shows the current situation of the generation today; not all but some. In weirdness comes beauty...nevermind, haha! </p>
               <p> Special mention to <a href="">About Time</a> and <a href="">Marly and Me</a>! I still love you guys teehee. </p>

               <em>Sing with me and make me proud; 3 MUST-LISTEN TO EAR CANDIES</em>
               <p> To start this list, I shall introduce you to one of my favorite artists today, Fifth Harmony a.k.a 5H. The first ear candy that you should know about is <a href="">this</a>. Okay okay so it's in Spanish but seriously, don't you think they sound... <q><em>sexy</em></q>? Major girl group crush here, ladies and gentlemen! </p>
               <p> Another song that you should definitely listen to is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emOKaGi8u5U">Classic</a> but I love <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOrHUNRNAWI">this</a> version better. I'm all about music like this, check my phone. I don't know... I just really have a soft spot for easy-sounding music. </p>
               <p> For my last song pick - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5XNWFw5HVw">Burn</a> as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Sy19X0xxrM">Confessions Part Two</a>. I'm sorry for lying but these two songs by Usher are just amazing! Apart from them having R&B roots (who doesn't like R&B songs, right?!), they somehow remind me of the Harry Potter series - a book series that has <em>MY CHILDHOOD</em> written all over it. These songs, especially Burn would be playing in the background while I'm on my bed, a Harry Potter book in hand and the windows open, curtains slow dancing with the light breeze... wow, those times were so chill and stress-free. <strong> Take me back huhu </strong> </p>
               <p> Just a bonus:<br/>I'm an optimistic and happy person, mind you. So I tend to listen to happy-sounding music. One song that I always end up listening to <strong> every day </strong> is strong> every day </strong> is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ryPPOQHES8">Better in the morning</a>. This song will certainly jumpstart one's day! Aside from the message, the tone of the song is light and breezy so it's nice to walk to it :) </p>
