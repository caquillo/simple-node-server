               <p> <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/"><img src="/images/childhood.jpg" alt="A photo from my childhood" style="width:200px; height:150px"></a> I could safely say that my childhood was the <strong> chillest </strong> perioud of my life. I wouldn't say the best because <em>life</em>, in itself, <em>is a journey</em>, so I'm betting that better days are about to come. Still, I am VERY fond of my childhood. I spent most of it studying actually, having started at 3 years old; I remember my grandfather always being the one to put my hair up into pig tails every morning before school; having two packs of pancit canton for breakfast (ah yes, those good times where my mum would still let us eat such msg-laden food); dancing to the song <q><em>Pearly Shell</em></q> for a class presentation; the list could go on and on. One thing that I dearly miss from my childhood is taking care of my baby brother (who's now taller than me); I like kids you see. So it was such a relief when my mom gave birth to another baby, this time a girl, when I was about to face another chapter of my life - high school.  </p>
               
               <p> <a href="http://simple-node-server-caquillo.c9.io/html-exercises/text-formatting-1.html"><img src="/images/high school.jpg" alt="During high school" style="width:150px; height:200px"></a> High school is a <strong> breeze </strong> compared to college...or so I thought. But anyway, I spent my high school days in <abbr title ="Assumption Antipolo">AA</abbr>, just like where I spent most of my childhood so it wasn't much of a transition for me, environment wise. However, things really do change when you're in high school - you actually stop caring (that much) about how people see you and what they think about you; you start taking on more responsibilities that require more time and effort and courage from you; in other words, you start growing up. You start to realize that life isn't just black and white. During this time, I started coming into terms with who I am and being proud of it. This was the period of my life where I was beginning to realize that I could be capable of so much. </p>

I am still learning about myself and the world around me every single day.  </p>
               
               <p> <a href="http://google.com"><img src="/images/future.jpg" alt="This should be me in the future" style="width:200px; height:150px"></a> I still don't have a set plan on what to be when I'm older...and more mature; however, I know that I want to make a change, I want to be able to bring change to people's lives. No idea when or how but I believe that I can do this. I'm not going to lie, I am <em>very much scared</em> of what is to come in my life but I am looking forward to what destiny has in store for me.  </p>
