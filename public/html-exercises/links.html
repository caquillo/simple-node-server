               <h3>WILDCARDS: A sure way to get on my good side</h3>
               <em>Watch these with me or no popcorn for you</em>
               <p>Let's work our way backwards, shall we? Earning the bronze medal for being my third favorite movie - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0817177/?ref_=ttqt_qt_tt">Flipped</a>, a movie wherein two eighth-graders proved that indeed, opposites really do attract. At first I thought this movie would just be <q><em>meh</em></q> since I've read the book; we all know what happens to books-gone-movies. But after giving into the constant pleads of my <em>main nigga</em> to watch it, I realized that <q>it was actually a <strong>good</strong> movie</q>. The movie had an almost-childlike innocence to it, downplaying the cheesiness of the story itself. Aside from that, the cinematography and the original soundtrack of the movie was very <strong>spot on</strong>. An added bonus: a good-looking lead actor and the wardrobe of the lead actress that is to die for.</p>
               <p>Winning the silver medal, the tag-team of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097757/">The Little Mermaid</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110357/">The Lion King</a>. I am so sorry but these two have really got to go with each other. Aside from these two being a list of the Disney classics, they've actually played a very large part in my childhood. FINISH THIS PARAGRAPH</p>
               <p>THE GOOOLD MEDAL GOES TO <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1454029/">THE HELP</a>. LOOOL ADD A SHORT DESCRIPTION</p>
